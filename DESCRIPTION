Description: Prediction markets utlizie the efficient market hypothesis to
    crowdsource the probability of political events and outcomes. Traders
    buy futures contracts with real money and the moving equilibirum price
    reflects underlying probability. Query the PredictIt API
    <https://www.predictit.org/api/marketdata/all/> to obtain a list of
    all active prediction markets, the current trading price of available
    contracts, or the price of contracts over a given time period.
